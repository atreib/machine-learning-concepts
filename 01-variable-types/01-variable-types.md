# Variable types

## Numeric variables

- Continuous: 2.7, 44.3, ... (float)
- Discretes: 1, 6, 333, ... (int)
  - A lot used to label the categoric variables for some algorithms

## Categorical variables (string)

> As said above, some algorithms don't accepts categoric variables, only accepting numbers. We will see some pre-processing tools that will label our categoric variables into discrete variables.

- Nominal: non-measurable, don't have a order (eye color, gender, ...)
- Ordinal: categories with a specific order (clothing size - XS, S, M, L, XL...)
